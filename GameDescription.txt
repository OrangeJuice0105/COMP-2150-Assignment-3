The objective of Greed is to erase as much as of the screen as possible by moving around in a greed of numbers.

In order to move, press any number to move in the board. The direction you chose to move will be based on the number of keypads. 
Specifically, the directions are based on the following keypad layout:

    7-8-9         up left -  up  - up right
    4-5-6            left - stay - right
    1-2-3       down left - down - down right

Your current location is specified by the '@' symbol. 

When you move in a direction, you consume N numbers on the grid, where N is the number in that direction. 
Your scores are the total numbers you have cleared on the board. 
The game continues until you have no more moves to make, where the game will exit automatically.
If you want to quit the game, simply enter 0 ingame to give up.

Have fun with the game!
